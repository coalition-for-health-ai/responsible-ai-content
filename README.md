# Responsible AI Content
**Overview**

This repository includes use case folders with consensus-defined Testing and Evaluation Frameworks. When completing the CHAI Applied Model Card, review use case specific Testing and Evaluation Frameworks for additional CHAI consensus-defined guidance.

A Testing and Evaluation (T&E) Framework includes a consensus-defined set of methods, metrics, measures, and/or benchmarks for developers and implementers to more concretely evaluate the responsible use of health AI solutions for a given use case. Content within a T&E Framework varies based on use case and type.

**CHAI Vision**

By displaying this content on GitHub we: 
1.	Welcome feedback and new evidence/examples for or against the use of a particular method or metric for a given use case. We have two methods for individuals to provide feedback once information is posted to the public repository. 
a.	For those who use GitHub, we have created a GitHub issue form. 
b.	For those who would rather not use GitHub, we have created a Microsoft form, which will automatically generate a GitHub Issue in the repository. 
c.	Issues raised will be prioritized, changes determined, committed, and reflected through version control (see GitHub Standard Operating Procedures Section Below). 
2.	Aim to stay relevant and up to date in a rapidly changing and growing field. We recognize that methods, metrics, and evidence in some areas are emerging, while in others they may be more established. 
3.	Want to prioritize getting information to our community rapidly and in a way that is useful. Waiting for documents to be “ideal” in a space where there are still uncertainties and unknowns, often delays dissemination. 
4.	Want to support the development of an open-source community that includes CHAI members and other domain experts who can begin testing these methods and metrics, providing examples, and filling any gaps in information.
5.	Important Notes:
  - The content you see below will have blanks. This may be because it was outside of the scope of a specific workgroup focus, because the domain was added post content development, or because information still needs to be added. We welcome these additions from our community and other domain experts.
  - Content that is included was agreed upon by workgroup members and leads (See GitHub Standard Operating Procedures Section below). 


**Disclaimer**

This repository contains living documents that are continuously evolving. The content herein is a work in progress, subject to change, and may not always reflect the latest best practices, guidelines, or recommendations. Users are encouraged to review and use the content at their own discretion. Contributions, feedback, and discussions are always welcome to help refine and improve the material over time.

# CHAI GitHub Standard Operating Procedures

## Purpose
Develop a set of standard operating procedures for CHAI Program Management and CHAI community alignment and adherence.

## Table of Contents
- [Feedback Process](#feedback-process)
- [Editing the Repository](#editing-the-repository)
- [Version Control](#version-control)
- [Key Terms](#key-terms)

## Feedback Process

1.	Reviewer submits a ticket via the [Feedback Form](https://forms.office.com/r/6LDSZcv9cu) or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/coalition-for-health-ai/responsible-ai-content/issues/new?template=FeedbackForm.yml).
2.	CHAI Program Management team and workgroup leads review, determine if a change needs to be made to the repository, and defines what the scope of that change will be.
3.	Any issue that will result in a change will result in a Pull Request (PR). 
4.	CHAI Program Management + non-CHAI Work Group Committer(s) will approve the PR and changes will automatically be reflected in the latest version of the repository.

## Editing the Repository

- Diversity of Committers: CHAI will ensure multiple organizations are committing changes to the CHAI GitHub, not just CHAI internal team. At least two individuals, representing separate organizations, will be identified as committers for each use-case workgroup. 

## Version Control
- v0.1: Work Group members edit offline and in private repository during v0.1 of use case content development
- v0.2: CHAI Program Management will send a draft to CHAI Board and CHAI Members for early viewing 5 business days prior to pushing content to the public repository. 
- v0.3: CHAI Program Management then pushes content to public repository for Members and Public to view and continuously contribute to/iterate on. Feedback received from release to week 4 post-release will be considered priority feedback prior to updating to v1.0.  
- v1.0: resolve priority feedback and reflect in work product (v1.0)


For Future versions (post-v1.0)
-	Major revision: e.g., v2.0: new UI or format, several new features, conceptual changes, content changes, etc.
-	Minor revision: e.g., v1.1: minor new UI or format, few new features, collection of bug fixes

## Key Terms
-	**CHAI Majority Consensus**, from International Organization for Standards (ISO): "text is approved as an International Standard (IS)… if a two-thirds majority of the P-members (participating-members)… in favor and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative" [linked here](https://www.iso.org/sites/ConsumersStandards/voting_iso.html)
-	**CHAI Work Group Quorum**, summarized from IEEE and HL7: in many work groups, sets quorum as 50% + 1 (simple majority); however, quorum is up to discretion of each work group. [linked here](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/TSC/pages/130483151/Generic+HL7+Work+Group+DMP)
  -	Specifically, from HL7 Governance and Operations Manual: "Unless otherwise noted, motions shall be resolved by simple majority or quorum." [linked here](https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf)
  -	Appendix: "CHAI Work Group Quorum applies to any decisions that are made live on calls. For asynchronous decisions, all 100% of Work Group members will be informed of the request. Lack of response indicates an Abstain vote."
