# Responsible AI Content
**Overview**

This repository includes use case folders with consensus-defined Testing and Evaluation Frameworks. When completing the CHAI Applied Model Card, review use case specific Testing and Evaluation Frameworks for additional CHAI-endorsed guidance.

A Testing and Evaluation (T&E) Framework includes a consensus-defined set of methods, metrics, measures, and/or benchmarks for developers and implementers to more concretely evaluate the responsible use of health AI solutions for a given use case. Content within a T&E Framework varies based on use case and type.

# CHAI GitHub Standard Operating Procedures

**Last updated: February 10, 2025**

## Purpose
Develop a set of standard operating procedures for CHAI Program Management and CHAI community alignment and adherence.

## Table of Contents
- [Feedback Process](#feedback-process)
- [Editing the GitHub Repository](#editing-the-github-repository)
- [Good Practices](#good-practices)

## Feedback Process

Feedback Form is available [here](https://github.com/coalition-for-health-ai/responsible-ai-content/issues/new?template=FeedbackForm.yml).

1. Reviewer submits an Issue via the Feedback Form.
2. CHAI Program Management team reviews, determines if a change needs to be made to the repository, and defines what the content change is.
3. CHAI assigns who will be the Contributor to submit a Pull Request (PR) with the language as defined in step 3.
4. CHAI Program Management approves the PR; changes are automatically reflected in the latest version of the repository.

## Editing the Repository

- Diversity of Committers: CHAI will ensure multiple organizations are committing changes to the CHAI GitHub, not just CHAI internal team.

## Good Practices

- Ensure CHAI communicates major releases and minor releases of the responsible-ai-content repository with the CHAI community and public.
- Develop criteria for when/how CHAI will classify “major” and “minor” releases.
- Use GitBook to provide structure, layout, etc., to improve content presentation for the senior leadership team and non-technical stakeholders.
- Ensure non-technical reviewers can easily leave Issues in the repository.
- Avoid linking open-source tools directly in the GitHub repository due to security risks. CHAI will only list the names of repositories that include open-source content.
