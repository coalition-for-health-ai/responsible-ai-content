# Responsible AI Content
**Overview**

This repository includes use case folders with consensus-defined Testing and Evaluation Frameworks. When completing the CHAI Applied Model Card, review use case specific Testing and Evaluation Frameworks for additional CHAI-endorsed guidance.

A Testing and Evaluation (T&E) Framework includes a consensus-defined set of methods, metrics, measures, and/or benchmarks for developers and implementers to more concretely evaluate the responsible use of health AI solutions for a given use case. Content within a T&E Framework varies based on use case and type.

**Disclaimer**

This repository contains living documents that are continuously evolving. The content herein is a work in progress, subject to change, and may not always reflect the latest best practices, guidelines, or recommendations. Users are encouraged to review and use the content at their own discretion. Contributions, feedback, and discussions are always welcome to help refine and improve the material over time.

# CHAI GitHub Standard Operating Procedures

## Purpose
Develop a set of standard operating procedures for CHAI Program Management and CHAI community alignment and adherence.

## Table of Contents
- [Feedback Process](#feedback-process)

- [Key Terms](#key-terms)

## Feedback Process

Feedback Form is available [here](https://github.com/coalition-for-health-ai/responsible-ai-content/issues/new?template=FeedbackForm.yml).

1. Reviewer submits an Issue via the Feedback Form.
2. CHAI Program Management team reviews, determines if a change needs to be made to the repository, and defines what the content change is.
3. CHAI assigns who will be the Contributor to submit a Pull Request (PR) with the language as defined in step 3.
4. CHAI Program Management + non-CHAI organizational Work Group Committer(s) approve the PR; changes are automatically reflected in the latest version of the repository.

## Editing the Repository

- Diversity of Committers: CHAI will ensure multiple organizations are committing changes to the CHAI GitHub, not just CHAI internal team.

## Version Control
-	v0.1: Work Group members edit offline and in private repository during v0.1 of use case content development
-	v0.2: CHAI Program Management then pushes content to public repository for v0.2 of use case content; CHAI Board, CHAI Members, and Public can review content during ~2-4-week Public Feedback Period
-	v1.0: resolve priority feedback and reflect in work product (v1.0)

For Future versions (post-v1.0)
-	Major revision: e.g., v2.0: new UI or format, several new features, conceptual changes, content changes, etc.
-	Minor revision: e.g., v1.1: minor new UI or format, few new features, collection of bug fixes

## Key Terms
-	**CHAI Majority Consensus**, from International Organization for Standards (ISO): “text is approved as an International Standard (IS)… if a two-thirds majority of the P-members (participating-members)… in favor and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative” [linked here](https://www.iso.org/sites/ConsumersStandards/voting_iso.html)
-	**CHAI Work Group Quorum**, summarized from IEEE and HL7: in many work groups, sets quorum as 50% + 1 (simple majority); however, quorum is up to discretion of each work group. [linked here](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/TSC/pages/130483151/Generic+HL7+Work+Group+DMP)
  -	Specifically, from HL7 Governance and Operations Manual: “Unless otherwise noted, motions shall be resolved by simple majority or quorum.” [linked here](https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf)
  -	Appendix: “CHAI Work Group Quorum applies to any decisions that are made live on calls. For asynchronous decisions, all 100% of Work Group members will be informed of the request. Lack of response indicates an Abstain vote.”
