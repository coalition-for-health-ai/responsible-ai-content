# Governance Structure

## Decision-Making Process

1. Decisions are made through CHAI Majority Consensus ([ISO Voting Standards](https://www.iso.org/sites/ConsumersStandards/voting_iso.html)).
2. Work Group Quorum applies for live decisions (50% + 1 majority); asynchronous decisions require notification of all members ([HL7 Governance Manual](https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf)).

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **CHAI Program Management**: Oversees repository management and ensures alignment with organizational goals.
- **Work Group Committers**: Represent diverse organizations and contribute expertise.
