CHAI Responsible AI Content documentation
=========================================

This documentation includes use case folders with consensus-defined
Testing and Evaluation Frameworks. When completing the CHAI Applied
Model Card, review use case-specific Testing and Evaluation Frameworks
for additional CHAI consensus-defined guidance.

A Testing and Evaluation (T&E) Framework includes a consensus-defined
set of methods, metrics, measures, and/or benchmarks for developers and
implementers to more concretely evaluate the responsible use of health
AI solutions for a given use case. Content within a T&E Framework varies
based on use case and type.

By releasing this content under an open-source license, we:

#. Welcome feedback and new evidence/examples for or against the use of
   a particular method or metric for a given use case. We have two
   methods for individuals to provide feedback once information is
   posted to the public repository.

   - For those who use GitHub, we have created a `GitHub Issue
     form <https://github.com/coalition-for-health-ai/responsible-ai-content/issues/new?template=FeedbackForm.yml>`__.
   - For those who would rather not use GitHub, we have created a
     `Microsoft Form <https://forms.office.com/r/6LDSZcv9cu>`__, which
     will automatically generate a GitHub Issue in the repository.
   - Issues raised will be prioritized, changes determined, committed,
     and reflected through version control (see
     :doc:`/community/governance` and :doc:`/community/contributing`).

#. Aim to stay relevant and up to date in a rapidly changing and growing
   field. We recognize that methods, metrics, and evidence in some areas
   are emerging, while in others they may be more established.
#. Want to prioritize getting information to our community rapidly and
   in a way that is useful. Waiting for documents to be “ideal” in a
   space where there are still uncertainties and unknowns, often delays
   dissemination.
#. Want to support the development of an open-source community that
   includes CHAI members and other domain experts who can begin testing
   these methods and metrics, providing examples, and filling any gaps
   in information.
#. Important Notes:

   - The content you see below will have blanks. This may be because it
     was outside of the scope of a specific workgroup focus, because the
     domain was added after content development, or because information
     still needs to be added. We welcome these additions from our
     community and other domain experts.
   - Content that is included was agreed upon by workgroup members and
     leads (see :doc:`/community/governance` and
     :doc:`/community/contributing`).
