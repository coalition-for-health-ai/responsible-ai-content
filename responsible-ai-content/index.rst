CHAI Responsible AI Content documentation
=========================================

This documentation includes use case folders with consensus-defined
Testing and Evaluation Frameworks. When completing the CHAI Applied
Model Card, review use case-specific Testing and Evaluation Frameworks
for additional CHAI consensus-defined guidance.

A Testing and Evaluation (T&E) Framework includes a consensus-defined
set of methods, metrics, measures, and/or benchmarks for developers and
implementers to more concretely evaluate the responsible use of health
AI solutions for a given use case. Content within a T&E Framework varies
based on use case and type.
