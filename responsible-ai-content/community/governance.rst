Governance Structure
====================

Decision-Making Process
-----------------------

1. Decisions are made through CHAI Majority Consensus (`ISO Voting
   Standards <https://www.iso.org/sites/ConsumersStandards/voting_iso.html>`__).
2. Work Group Quorum applies for live decisions (50% + 1 majority);
   asynchronous decisions require notification of all members (`HL7
   Governance
   Manual <https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf>`__).

Editing the Repository
----------------------

- **Diversity of Committers**: At least two committers from separate
  organizations will contribute to each use-case workgroup.
- Ensure edits align with CHAI's goals of inclusivity and transparency.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

- **CHAI Program Management**: Oversees repository management and
  ensures alignment with organizational goals.
- **Work Group Committers**: Represent diverse organizations and
  contribute expertise.

Version Control
---------------

- **v0.1**: Initial content development in a private repository.
- **v0.2**: Draft shared with CHAI Board and Members for early review (5
  business days before public release).
- **v0.3**: Content pushed to public repository for continuous
  contributions.
- **v1.0**: Priority feedback incorporated before finalizing.

For future versions:

- **Major revisions (e.g., v2.0)**: Significant changes like new UI,
  features, or conceptual updates.
- **Minor revisions (e.g., v1.1)**: Small updates, bug fixes, or minor
  features.

Key Terms
---------

- **CHAI Majority Consensus**: Decisions approved by two-thirds of
  participating members with no more than one-quarter negative votes
  (`ISO Voting
  Standards <https://www.iso.org/sites/ConsumersStandards/voting_iso.html>`__).
- **CHAI Work Group Quorum**: Decisions require a simple majority during
  live calls; asynchronous decisions assume abstention for non-responses
  (`HL7 Governance
  Manual <https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf>`__).
