Thank You
---------
We want to start by thanking every individual who showed interest, participated, listened, and came along with us in the early stages of our work. CHAI is at its core, a convener, and a member-driven non-profit. We are so grateful to be on this journey with you towards responsible AI in health for all. Your experiences, your feedback, your contributions, all make us who we are and help bring us to where we need to be.

For those who want to be credited directly by name, please reach out to us at program-management@chai.org to request contribution credit for the Prior Authorization Work Group. Below is a list of organizations who had at least one individual who showed interest and/or participated in our Prior Authorization Work Group.

If you want to learn more about our work groups (current and future), or have feedback on CHAI work groups, products, or services, please contact our Director of Responsible AI: merage@chai.org and Program Manager: anthony@chai.org.
