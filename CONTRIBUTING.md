- **v0.3**: Content pushed to public repository for continuous contributions.
- **v1.0**: Priority feedback incorporated before finalizing.

For future versions:
- **Major revisions (e.g., v2.0)**: Significant changes like new UI, features, or conceptual updates.

## Key Terms

- **CHAI Majority Consensus**: Decisions approved by two-thirds of participating members with no more than one-quarter negative votes ([ISO Voting Standards](https://www.iso.org/sites/ConsumersStandards/voting_iso.html)).
- **CHAI Work Group Quorum**: Decisions require a simple majority during live calls; asynchronous decisions assume abstention for non-responses ([HL7 Governance Manual](https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf)).
